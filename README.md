# Module-6: PYTHON OOP CONCEPTS

This repository explores fundamental and advanced concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, including the four pillars of OOP.

## Topics Covered

Each Markdown file provides detailed explanations and examples for the following Python OOP principles:

* **Abstraction**
    * Covers the concept of abstraction, using abstract classes and methods to hide complex implementations.
    * *Files:* `Abstraction.md`, `abstractClassandMethod.png`

* **Encapsulation**
    * Demonstrates encapsulation, the bundling of data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit.
    * *Files:* `Encapsulation.md`, `encapsulation.png`

* **Method Overriding**
    * Explains how method overriding works, allowing a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its superclasses.
    * *Files:* `Method Overriding.md`, `method_override.png`

* **Operator Overloading (e.g., Less Than)**
    * Illustrates how to overload operators like 'less than' (`<`) for custom classes in Python.
    * *Files:* `Operator Overloading Less Than (>).md`, `opoverload.png`

* **Polymorphism with Classes**
    * Covers polymorphism, showcasing how objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common class through method overriding and inheritance.
    * *Files:* `Polymorphism with Classes.md`, `polymorph.png`
